What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI)
React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.

What is the DOM?
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
DOM is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents which shows the logical structure of documents and how a document is manipulated and accessed.

DOM (Document Object Model) is slow.
ReactJS DOM vs Virtual DOM: What is The Difference?

Disadvantages of real DOM :
Every time the DOM gets updated, the updated element and its children have to be rendered again to update the UI of our page. 
For this, each time there is a component update, the DOM needs to be updated and the UI components have to be re-rendered.

How does React use Virtual DOM?
In React every UI piece is a component, and each component has a state. React follows the observable pattern and listens for state changes. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM tree. Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React then compares the current version of the virtual DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM. This process is called “diffing”.
Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates only those objects, in the real DOM.

Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering
Hooks rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.
